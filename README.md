Hello, this is my personal NeoVIM config based on popular (yet efffective) tools.
I use it on Linux machines (more specifically debian based distros/ubuntu and sometimes archlinux).

**Prerequisites:**

    1. NeoVIM version >0.9.0
    2. VimPlug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

__Installation:__

 1. Create a directory named "nvim" in your ~/.config directory.
 2. Copy the contents of my folder into yours.
 3. Open NeoVim and type ':PlugInstall'.
 4. After everything is installed exit to refresh NeoVim.
 5. Your config should be ready to use!


- Feel free to fork!

- For any recommendations make a pull request.


__Disclaimer__: This is my PERSONAL nvim configuration that I use and fits my specific needs. If you have any errors with ANY of the packages you should check the appropriate github/wiki/stack page for any info regarding your troubleshooting.
