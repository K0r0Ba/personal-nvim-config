Hello, this is my personal NeoVIM config based on popular (yet efffective) tools.
I use it on Linux machines (more specifically debian based distros/ubuntu).

**Prerequisites:**

    1. NeoVIM version >0.9.0
    2. VimPlug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

__Installation:__

    You can take the folder "nvim" and copy it as is into your into your ~/.config folder or you 
    can make your own adjustments/modifications before/after installing.


- Feel free to fork!

- For any recommendations make a pull request.


__Disclaimer__: This is my PERSONAL nvim configuration that I use and fits my specific needs.
